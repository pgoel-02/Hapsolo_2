# HapSolo 2

HapSolo2 is an AI optimization approach for removing secondary haplotigs during diploid genome assembly and scaffolding. Essentially, Hapsolo2 implements a forward-looking randomized hill-climbing algorithm, which is where the AI comes in, in Python. Libraries used include Pandas, Torch, and CuDF. 

This project is an extension of HapSolo, which can be found here: https://github.com/esolares/HapSolo

This project is a part of an Undergraduate AI Research position that I've had since June 2022. HapSolo2 was co-developed by Mansi A.
