# HapSolo2

HapSolo2 is an AI optimization approach for removing secondary haplotigs during diploid genome assembly and scaffolding. Essentially, Hapsolo2 implements a forward-looking randomized hill-climbing algorithm, which is where the AI comes in, to minimize the cost of genomic assemblies. 

HapSolo2 is coded completely in Python, and libraries used include Pandas, Torch, and CuDF. This project is an extension of HapSolo, which can be found here: https://github.com/esolares/HapSolo

This project is a part of an Undergraduate AI Research position that I've had since June 2022. HapSolo2 was co-developed by Mansi A.
